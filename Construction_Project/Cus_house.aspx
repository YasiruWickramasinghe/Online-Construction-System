    <p class="card-text">The Housing Corporation is the key agency regulating delivery of housing in the social housing sector. 
        They assist with delivery of policy via grants awarded through the Approved Development Programme (ADP).
        A proportion of the ADP has been ring-fenced (The Challenge Fund) for the delivery of new homes quickly and cost effectively,
        in areas of high demand as well as stimulating a step change in supply by encouraging innovative forms of construction.
       In the face of the support from political and regulatory authorities to make greater use of modern methods,
        lots of stakeholders are still unsure about modern methods of construction for some of reasons. In the case of housing associations there is doubt about whether or not modern methods are able to deliver energy efficient homes at good reasonable prices. This pamphlet aims to demonstrate that homes that cross the requirements of building regulations in sense of their material efficiency can be built cost-effectively.
